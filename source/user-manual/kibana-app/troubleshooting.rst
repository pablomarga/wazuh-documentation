Troubleshooting
===============

This section collects common installation or usage problems on the Wazuh Kibana plugin, and some basic steps to solve them.

"Incorrect Kibana version in plugin [wazuh]" when installing the Wazuh Kibana plugin
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Wazuh Kibana plugin must be installed in the correct version, which depends both on the Kibana and the Wazuh version.

Kibana version can be checked by executing the following command:

.. code-block:: console

 # cat /usr/share/kibana/package.json | grep version

An example output of the command looks as follows:

.. code-block:: console
  :class: output

  "version": "7.10.0",


The Wazuh version can be checked by executing the following command:

.. code-block:: console

 # cat /var/ossec/etc/ossec-init.conf | grep VERSION

An example output of the command looks as follows:

.. code-block:: console
  :class: output

  VERSION="v4.1.1"

Using the Kibana version and the Wazuh version, the correct plugin can be found in the Wazuh `compatibility matrix <https://github.com/wazuh/wazuh-kibana-app/#wazuh---kibana---open-distro-version-compatibility-matrix>`_.

No template found for the selected index pattern
------------------------------------------------

Elasticsearch needs a specific template to store Wazuh alerts, otherwise visualizations won't load properly. You can insert the correct template using the following command:

.. code-block:: console

  # curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/wazuh/wazuh/v|WAZUH_LATEST|/extensions/elasticsearch/7.x/wazuh-template.json | curl -X PUT "https://localhost:9200/_template/wazuh" -H 'Content-Type: application/json' -d @- -u <user>:<password> -k

.. code-block:: json
  :class: output

  {"acknowledged":true}

.. warning::
  Indices with the wrong template will need to be reindexed. You can follow our :ref:`reindexation guide <restore_alerts_2.x_3.x>`.

Wazuh API seems to be down
--------------------------

It means your Wazuh API could be unavailable. Since the Wazuh Kibana plugin needs data from the Wazuh API, it must be available for the Wazuh Kibana plugin.

.. tabs::


  .. group-tab:: Systemd


    .. code-block:: console

      # systemctl status wazuh-manager



  .. group-tab:: SysV init

    .. code-block:: console

      # service wazuh-manager status


If the Wazuh API is running, try to fetch data using the CLI from the Kibana server:

.. code-block:: console

  # curl -k -X GET "https://<api_url>:55000/" -H "Authorization: Bearer $(curl -u <api_user>:<api_password> -k -X GET 'https://<api_url>:55000/security/user/authenticate?raw=true')"

.. code-block:: console
  :class: output

    % Total    % Received % Xferd  Average Speed   Time    Time     Time  Current
                                 Dload  Upload   Total   Spent    Left  Speed
    100   271  100   271    0     0    879      0 --:--:-- --:--:-- --:--:--   882
    {"data": {"title": "Wazuh API REST", "api_version": "4.1.1", "revision": 40110, "license_name": "GPL 2.0", "license_url": "https://github.com/wazuh/wazuh/blob/4.1/LICENSE", "hostname": "localhost.localdomain", "timestamp": "2021-03-03T10:01:18+0000"}, "error": 0}



I do not see alerts in the Wazuh Kibana plugin
----------------------------------------------

The first step is to check if there are alerts in Elasticsearch.

.. code-block:: console

  # curl https://<ELASTICSEARCH_IP>:9200/_cat/indices/wazuh-alerts-* -u <username>:<password> -k

.. code-block:: none
    :class: output

     green open wazuh-alerts-4.x-2021.03.03 xwFPX7nFQxGy-O5aBA3LFQ 3 0 340 0 672.6kb 672.6kb

If you do not see any Wazuh related index, it means you have no alerts stored in Elasticsearch.

To ensure that Filebeat is correctly configured, run the following command:

.. code-block:: console

  # filebeat test output

.. code-block:: none
          :class: output

          elasticsearch: https://127.0.0.1:9200...
            parse url... OK
            connection...
              parse host... OK
              dns lookup... OK
              addresses: 127.0.0.1
              dial up... OK
            TLS...
              security: server's certificate chain verification is enabled
              handshake... OK
              TLS version: TLSv1.3
              dial up... OK
            talk to server... OK
            version: 7.10.0



Could not connect to API with id: default: 3003 - Missing param: API USERNAME
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Starting Wazuh 4.0 the Wazuh API username variable changed from ``user`` to ``username``. It's necessary to change the credentials (foo:bar are no longer accepted) as well as the name of the variable in the ``/usr/share/kibana/data/wazuh/config/wazuh.yml`` configuration file. For example, the configuration can be: 

.. code-block:: console
   
   hosts:
    - production:
        url: https://localhost
        port: 55000
        username: wazuh-wui
        password: wazuh-wui
        run_as: false

        
App page goes blank
-------------------
Sometimes after and upgrade could happen that after loading the app page goes blank, this is due to some problem with the cache memory of the browser. 

.. thumbnail:: ../../images/kibana-app/troubleshooting/page_goes_blank.png
    :title: Page goes blank
    :align: left
    :width: 100%


To fix that you need to:

1. **Open the browser DevTools:** Right-click on any element of the page and select Inspect.

2. **Go to the application tab:** On the left you should see a section called ``Clear storage``  and click on ``Clear site data``.

After following this two steps a refresh of the page is needed.

None of the above solutions are fixing my problem
-------------------------------------------------

All the technologies we are using have their own logs files, you can check them and look for error and warning messages.

1. Check the Elastic Stack log files:

    .. code-block:: console

      # cat /var/log/elasticsearch/elasticsearch.log | grep -i -E "error|warn"
      # cat /var/log/filebeat/filebeat | grep -i -E "error|warn"

    .. note::
      The Elastic Stack uses the ``/var/log`` folder to store logs by default. This setting can be customized following the documentation for `Elasticsearch <https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/logging.html>`_ or `Filebeat <https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/beats/filebeat/current/configuration-logging.html>`_.

    .. warning::
      By default, Kibana doesn't store logs on a file. It can be configured with the ``logging.dest`` setting in the ``kibana.yml`` configuration file. Check the `Kibana documentation <https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/kibana/current/settings.html>`_ for more details.

2. Check the Wazuh Kibana plugin log file:

    .. code-block:: console

      # cat /usr/share/kibana/optimize/wazuh-logs/wazuhapp.log | grep -i -E "error|warn"

3. Check the Wazuh manager log file:

    .. code-block:: console

      # cat /var/ossec/logs/ossec.log | grep -i -E "error|warn"
